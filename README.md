Smart Traffic Management System ðŸš¦

An AI-powered system for vehicle detection, traffic prediction, and adaptive traffic light control.
This project combines computer vision, data analytics, and simulation models to improve road traffic efficiency and reduce congestion.

âœ¨ Features:

ðŸš— Vehicle Detection â€“ Detect and count vehicles in real-time from video or camera streams.

ðŸ“ˆ Traffic Prediction â€“ Forecast traffic flow using historical datasets.

ðŸŸ¢ Adaptive Signal Control â€“ Dynamically adjust traffic light timing based on traffic conditions.

ðŸ“Š Simulation Dashboard â€“ Visualize traffic flow, signal states, and predictions.

ðŸ”§ Modular Design â€“ Separate AI, simulation, and visualization modules for flexibility.
